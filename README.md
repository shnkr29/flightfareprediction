‚úàÔ∏èFlight Price Prediction Data Science Projectüåê

This project focuses on the application of data science techniques to predict flight prices accurately, aiming to address the challenges associated with the dynamic nature of airfares.

Objective: The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that leverages historical data, machine learning algorithms, and real-time market trends to empower users with insights for informed decision-making in ‚úàÔ∏è air travel planning.

üìä Tasks:

Data Collection and Cleaning:

Import the flight price prediction dataset.
Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform necessary data transformations.
Descriptive Statistics Analysis:

Calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for relevant numerical variables.
Data Visualization:

Create appropriate visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, bar charts) to analyze the distribution of numerical variables and relationships between categorical and numerical variables.
Geographical Analysis:

Develop visualizations, such as heatmaps, to understand the density of flight prices across different locations.
Identify areas with the highest concentration of flights and price variations.
Relationship Analysis:

Investigate the relationship between flight price, airline, source, destination, and other relevant factors.
Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to identify significant differences in prices based on various factors.
Predictive Modeling:

Develop machine learning models to predict flight prices based on historical data and relevant features.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Analysis of Customer Satisfaction:

Explore the relationship between customer satisfaction and factors such as price, airline, and travel time.
Utilize metrics like reviews and ratings to measure customer satisfaction.
üó∫Ô∏è Dataset: The dataset utilized for this analysis contains historical flight data, including information on airlines, sources, destinations, prices, and customer reviews.
